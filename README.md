<h1 align="center"> Credit Fraud Detector </h1>

In this kernel we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. 

The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv
